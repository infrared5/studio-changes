# Changes

## 1.0.1

With this patch, the previous version is taken from the `CHANGES.md` instead of
using the `package.json` version. This makes the git log range work in case
there has been a release before. Also improved the npm scripts documentation
slightly.

## 1.0.0

- Add pre- and postversion scripts
- Inception
